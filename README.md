When the task list is empty, the background image appears on the screen and the sort buttons disappear

To understand up or down sorting, when pressed, an arrow appears showing the direction

When adding or changing a task, a pop-up alert with two buttons is called. 
And until the name for the task is specified, the add button will be inactive.

On the first screen, the logic of sorting by buttons is implemented, and on the second screen, it is implemented by completed or not completed; 

When the task status changes, it smoothly goes to its section.

P.S. Will be added a little later Unit-testing, UI testing
